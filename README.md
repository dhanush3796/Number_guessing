Introduction
The Number Guessing Game is a simple interactive game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game will give hints such as "Too High" or "Too Low" after each guess to help the player zero in on the correct answer.

This game is a fun way to improve logic and learn basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and random number generation.

Features

How to Play
When the game starts, you will be asked to input a range for guessing, such as numbers between 1 and 100.
The game will generate a random number within that range.
You will be prompted to guess the number.
After each guess, the game will tell you whether your guess was "Too High" or "Too Low".
Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
After you guess correctly, the game will display the number of attempts it took to guess the correct number.
You can choose to play again or exit the game.
